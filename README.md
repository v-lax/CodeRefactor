# CodingBootcamp_HW_Assignment1
Homework Assignment # 1 for UNC-Charlotte coding bootcamp. The purpose of this homework assignment is to 
go through the provided html and css file and refactor it (improve the code without changing the functionality of the code), which is meant to mimic a "on the job ticket" in the workplace. 


# Userstory
The index.html file loads in a website for a fake company called Horiseon. Our goal here is to update their website so that it is more accessible and optimized for search engines. 

# Refactor Changes

The following is a list of all the refactored changes we made. 

    1. Updated the title of the website from "website" to "Horiseon" (Shout out's to Max, our TA, for recommending this first change in our demo)
    2. Added in Semantic HTML elements as needed
    3. Updated HTML element by removing unecessary elements, classes, or id's. 
    4. Added alt attributes to html img elements
    5. Added comments to our css file
    6.
