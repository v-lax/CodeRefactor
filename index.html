            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that 
                users are searching for the right business as 
                they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. 
                Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase 
                your visibility and find the right customers for your 
                business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. 
                Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. 
                Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what 
                potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence 
                on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you 
                determine which platforms are suited to your brand, 
                using analytics to find the right markets and increase 
                your lead generation.
